        <h2>Forms</h2>
        <p>
            Forms are a way for a user to fill out and submit information. A user can use a form to fill out and submit. A form can be created by using a form tag.
        </p>
        <code><form action="" method="POST"></form></code>
        <p>The form tag usually has two parts of the tag, the action and the method. The action usually would lead to an action page and the method is how it will send the information.</p>
        <p>Within forms you can add inputs that allows the user to insert information.</p>
        <code><label for="fname">First Name: </label> <input id="fname" type="text"></code>
        <p>There are many forms of inputs that can be researched on how to make them. Some of them can be found in W3Schools.com</p>
        <p>To collect the information via javascript you have to create an event listener and grab the necessary values</p>
        <code>
            document.querySelector('input[type="submit"]').addEventListener('click', form)
            function form(event) {
                let first = document.getElementById("firstname").value;
                console.log(firstname);
                event.preventDefault();
            }
        </code>
        <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
        <p>An object is a group of information that specifically deals with a specific thing. For example this would be an example of a 2018 Ford Mustang</p>
        <code>var myCar = {
            make: 'Ford',
            model: 'Mustang',
            year: 2018
        </code>
        <p>There are more ways to create an object that you can read about in </p><a href="../week3/week3Notes.html">Week 3 Notes</a>
